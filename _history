I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession.  If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world—connections that he made through his career with the DEA.  I was astounded. I always thought that Hank was a very moral man, and I was thrown and confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time—something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed.  Every day, I think back on that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner—a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.  Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange what I guess you would call a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, but it failed. Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000.  Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it.</field></shadow></value></block></statement></block>"],[1,"www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n  <block type=\"pxt-on-start\"></block>\n  <block type=\"device_forever\"></block>\n"],[0,"</xm"]],"start1":12,"start2":12,"length1":2697,"length2":113}]},{"type":"edited","filename":"main.ts","patch":[{"diffs":[[-1,"basic.showString(\"My name is Walter Hartwell White.
